    <h3> WORK EXPERIENCE: </h3>
    <h3> AI/ML Engineer - VVDN Technologies Private Limited (September 2020 to Jan 2022) </h3>
    <li><b>Project</b>: Traffic survey using pole mounted camera</li>
    <p><b>Primary Goal</b>: To do traffic survey on highway in real time using 
        computer vision with accuracy not less than 90%</p>
    <p><b>Solution</b>: Explore the model compatibility with the device chosen and
         then training data for it by collecting videos from the client and from online sources. 
         Fine tuning it for improvement once deployed</p>
    <li><b>Project</b>: Building a surveillance camera for household purposes</li>
    <p><b>Primary Goal</b>: Design a camera that will alert the user if there is an 
        intruder, stray animal, package delivery and illegal parking in front of house</p>
    <p><b>Solution</b>: Selecting and training the architecture that supports the camera chipset 
        and fine tuning the model efficiency after deployment
    <p><li><b>Miscellaneous</b>: While working on the above projects involved in delivering POC to the clients 
        using Qualcommn chipsets, benchmarking of edge devices, implemented 
        reusable bash scripts for automation and organization of inference tasks, explored accelerating AI models using Google coral usb accelerator 
        and OpenVino Toolkit for Intel movidius NCS. Explored CUDA program for GPGPU</li></p>
        
    <h3>Assistant Manager – TPF Engineering Private Limited (Jul-2019 to August-2020)</h3>
    <li><b>Project</b>:  R&D in using Python for data analysis in Transportation planning and highway design</li>
    <p><b> Primary Goal</b>:To find out how Python can be used effectively in day to day activities 
        of a Transportation engineer </p>
    <p><b>Outcome</b>:
        <ul>
        <li>Found an effective way of plotting the profile of road using seaborn library of Python for quick check of profile crossover</li>
        <li>Achieved parametric design of Road Over Bridge for conceptual design using Dynamo plugin in Civil 3D, research on automation of classified vehicle count</li> 
        </ul>
    <li><b>Project</b>: Implementation of Building Information Modelling(BIM) for Highway Projects</li>
    <p><b> Primary Goal</b>:To provide an effective way of communication between the Structural engineers, 
        Transportation engineers, client and the organization using BIM concept
    <p><b>Solution</b>:
        3D models of road were designed based on surveyors data and Autodesk’s BIM management tool was used as a 
        single window of communication between the engineering team, client and the management team.
